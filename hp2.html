        <h2>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</h2>

        <p>This is the second story of Harry Potter's adventures at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. A mysterious elf tells Harry to expect trouble during his second year at Hogwarts, but nothing can prepare him for trees that fight back, flying cars, spiders that can talk, and a secret chamber that mysteriously opens after 50 years. </p>

        <p> Interesting Fact! </p>
        <p>Rowling found it difficult to finish Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets because she was afraid it would not live up to the expectations raised by Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. After delivering the manuscript to Bloomsbury on schedule, she took it back for six weeks of revision.</p>
