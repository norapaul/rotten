        <h2>Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix</h2>

        <p>Now in his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry learns that many in the wizarding community do not know the truth of his encounter with Lord Voldemort. Cornelius Fudge, minister of Magic, appoints his toady, Dolores Umbridge, as Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, for he fears that professor Dumbledore will take his job. But her teaching is deficient and her methods, cruel, so Harry prepares a group of students to defend the school against a rising tide of evil. </p>

        <p> Interesting Fact! </p>
        <p>In this book we are introduced to a new character, Dolores Umbridge, and lets just say that she isn't the nicest person we know of. Unsurprisingly, she is the most hated character of all time, more hated than Voldemort.</p>
        <p>The Order of the Phoenix is also the longest book of the whole series. After writing the book, JK Rowling realized there were many loop holes and took it back to fill them all in. </p>
